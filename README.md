## Getting the frontend to work
Every time a change is done in the bower or css, you need to go to View->Tools Window->Maven Projects.
Then execute the Maven Goal "clean install"

Make sure you have npm installed. Them run npm install bower. If you don't do this, I think you're maven install will fail.
